# ocean-color-handbook

This handbook is an introduction to data analysis using ocean colour remote sensing as a tool for marine environment protection and conservation by African Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs). In this handbook we delve into the fascinating world of phytoplankton blooms as viewed by satellites. This interactive sessions that accompany this manual will empower you to leverage Python for in-depth exploration of marine ecosystems, providing valuable insights into phytoplankton dynamics. Letâ€™s navigate the waves of remotely sensed data together and unlock the secrets hidden in ocean colour!

## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the ocean-color-handbook book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `ocean-color-handbook/` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean ocean-color-handbook/` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build ocean-color-handbook/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `ocean-color-handbook/_build/html/`.

### Hosting the book

Please see the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/web.html) to discover options for deploying a book online using services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify.

For GitHub and GitLab deployment specifically, the [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) includes templates for, and information about, optional continuous integration (CI) workflow files to help easily and automatically deploy books online with GitHub or GitLab. For example, if you chose `github` for the `include_ci` cookiecutter option, your book template was created with a GitHub actions workflow file that, once pushed to GitHub, automatically renders and pushes your book to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo and hosts it on GitHub Pages when a push or pull request is made to the main branch.
