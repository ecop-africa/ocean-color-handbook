# Definitions

## Geodesy

Geodesy is the branch of mathematics or science dealing with accurate
measurement of Earth's geometric shape, orientation in space, and gravity field,
including the changes of these properties with time.

## Geoid

The geoid is an equipotential, or level, surface of the earth’s gravity field.
The geoid, approximately, equals mean sea level (MSL) and generally differs from
local MSL by a metre or so. It is a complex shape influenced by the composition
of the earth so it may have discontinuities in its slope. This means that the
geoid’s surface is analytic as opposed to a mathematical surface like an
ellipsoid.

## Coordinate Systems

Coordinating system is a reference framework that defines locations of features
on the model of the earth as latitude and longitude. Its units are usually
degrees. Coordinate systems play a significant role in the way the physical
systems are described. Below we described the two most important coordinate
systems namely the Cartesian and the Spherical coordinate system.

## Map Projections

About Map Projections

### Projection categories

### Azimuthal Projections

These projections are based on a flat piece of paper touching the earth at a
point.

### Conic Projections

### Cylindrical Projections

Prior to that, it is worth noting that the creation of a map projection
generally involves these three steps:

1. Selection of a model for the shape of the body being projected (a sphere or
   ellipsoid)
2. Definition of a geographic coordinate transform from angular (longitude and
   latitude) to planar coordinates (easting and northing) or vice versa.
3. Reduce the scale (in manual cartography this step came second, in digital
   cartography it comes last)
