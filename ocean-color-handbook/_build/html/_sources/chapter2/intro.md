# A Brief Introduction to Python

## Overview

This chapter will start by introducing how a working
[Python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) can be set.
Then, the reader will be introduced to the basics of the
[Python programming language](https://www.python.org/), the language of choice
for this e-manual. Since the discussion revolves around [ocean colour](chapter3)
data analysis, the modules relevant for such analysis will be briefly
introduced. How to handle simple tasks associated with data input/output. The
reader is encouraged to explore beyond what is introduced here since the Python
ecosystem provides a wide range of libraries and frameworks that can be used for
the same end.

This chapter is targeted at beginners who either know a little programming or
are starting fresh with no programming experience.

### Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes of this chapter are:

- Understand the basic concepts and syntax of Python programming language;
- Understand modules relevant to Ocean Colour Data Analysis;
- Gain the ability to set up a Python working environment;
- Gain the ability to open and read files; and
- Gain the ability to create visualisations in Python.

### How to Proceed

This chapter serves as a basic introduction to Python. You do not need any prior
experience with programming to get started. Certain sections will refer to
online documentation and other resources that will assist with further
understanding and practice.

To proceed with this chapter, ensure that you have the Anaconda downloaded. You
can download the software for the operating system your computer runs
[here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and follow the guidelines
for installation [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). In
{numref}`why-python` below, brief guidelines are given on how to set up a
working Anaconda environment.

### Why Python

Python is a widely used, high-level programming language that is open-source,
meaning that it is made freely available. It was created by Guido van Rossum in
the 1980s and further developed by the
[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).The list of
features that make Python the language of choice is vast. To name but a few

1. Python was designed with emphasis on code readability with simple syntax,
   similar to English, which allows programmers to express concepts with fewer
   lines of code compared to traditional languages such as C/C++;
2. There are tons of libraries and frameworks for both scientific use and
   general purpose readily available in the Python ecosystem which makes it the
   language of choice for many data science projects. For instance, libraries
   such as scikit-learn provide the gateway to machine learning applications;
   and last but not least,
3. Python emerges as one of the widely used programming languages by many
   organisations around the world in computer science for Big data, Machine
   Learning and Cloud Computing.

For the above and beyond reasons, this e-manual will use Python as a tool to
open, manipulate and visualise Ocean Colour Data.
