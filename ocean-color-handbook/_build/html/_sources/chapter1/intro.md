# Introduction

## Overview

The purpose of this e-manual is to introduce the use of ocean colour remote
sensing and data analysis as a tool for marine environment protection and
conservation and has been produced by Early Career Ocean Professionals
([ECOP](https://www.ecopdecade.org/africa/) Africa). In-situ observations have
been traditionally used to evaluate water quality and quantify the state of
marine environment. However, in-situ observations are costly and limiting (both
spatially and temporally) as they are only able to provide point representation
of the ocean at a time. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of the ocean and
allows the quantification of water quality parameters over large spatial and
temporal scales consistently. Nonetheless, in-situ observations remain as
important means of accuracy evaluation of remotely sensed data such as ocean
colour remote sensing data.

This e-manual provides a basic introduction to ocean colour remote sensing and
the methodologies associated with the processing and analysis of such data, by
serving as to a step-by-step guide to help ECOPs understand the key principles
of ocean colour remote sensing, the various tools and software used in this
field, and the methodologies involved in retrieving and analysing ocean colour
data. The e-manual is written in an accessible language and provides practical
examples and illustrations where ECOPs navigate the complexities of ocean colour
remote sensing data analysis. It provides a clear and comprehensive guide, and
aims to empower ECOPs to conduct their own research and contribute to the global
understanding of the oceanographic environment. Whether you are a student,
researcher, or practitioner, this e-manual is an essential resource for anyone
who wants to leverage ocean colour remote sensing as a tool to understand the
impacts of the changing ocean on biological activity.

This initiative aims to contribute to the call for
[Decade Actions](https://oceandecade.org/decade-actions/) from the United
Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The Ocean Decade
(2021-2030) is aimed at accelerating the implementation of
[Sustainable Development Goal 14](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/)
for the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean, seas and marine
resources. This manual contributes to the above by addressing the following
Ocean Challenges

- Skills, knowledge and technology for all;
- Understand and beat marine pollution; and
- Expand the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).
