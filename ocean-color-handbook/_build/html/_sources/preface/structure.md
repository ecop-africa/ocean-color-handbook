# Structure of the book

The book is broken down into small “recipes” that aim to demonstrate a single
concept at a time. {numref}`Chapter {number}<chapter1>` provides
{ref}`chapter1`. {numref}`Chapter {number}<chapter2>` introduces
{ref}`chapter2`. {numref}`Chapter {number}<chapter3>` introduces
{ref}`chapter3`. {numref}`Chapter {number}<chapter4>` revolves around
{ref}`chapter4`. {numref}`Chapter {number}<chapter5>` makes use of all book
contents and introduces {ref}`chapter5`.
{numref}`Chapter {number}<case-studies>` makes use of all materials and presents
workflows around specific use cases.

Those who want a quick hands-on experience can move straight to
{numref}`Chapter {number}<case-studies>`. The first three chapters are
independent of each other.
