abstract = {Spectral fluorescence measurements of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chl a), phytoplankton phycobilipigments and variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm), are utilized with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) estimates of phytoplankton pigments and microscopic cells counts to construct a comprehensive picture of summer-time phytoplankton communities and their photosynthetic competency in the eastern Bering Sea shelf. Although the Bering Sea was ice-free during our study, the exceptionally cold winter that preceded the summer of 2008 when our cruise took place, facilitated the formation of a "Cold Pool" ({\textless}2. °C) and its entrapment at depth in the northern middle shelf. The presence of a strong pycnocline over the entire middle and outer shelves restricted inorganic nutrient fluxes into the surface waters resulting in phytoplankton populations that were photo-physiologically stressed due to nutrient limitation. Elevated Chl a concentr. ations recorded in the Green Belt along the shelf edge of the Bering Sea, were due to Phaeocystis pouchetii and nano-sized cryptophytes. Although inorganic nutrients were not limiting in the Green Belt, Fv/Fm values were low in all probability due to iron limitation. Phytoplankton communities in the low biomass surface waters of the middle shelf were comprised of prasinophytes, haptophytes, cryptophytes and diatoms. In the northern part of the middle shelf, a sinking bloom made up of the centric diatoms Chaeotoceros socialis, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii and Porosira glacialis was located above the Cold Pool. The high biomass associated with this senescent bloom and its accretion above the pycnocline, suggests that the Cold Pool acts as a barrier, preventing sinking phytoplankton from reaching the bottom where they can become available to benthic organisms. We further posit that if summer-time storms are not energetic enough and the Cold Pool is not eroded, its presence facilitates the transfer of the large spring phytoplankton bloom to the pelagic ecosystem.},

abstract = {The accurate retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) from ocean color satellite data is extremely challenging in turbid, optically complex coastal waters. Ariake Bay in Japan is a turbid semi-enclosed bay of great socio-economic significance, but it suffers from serious water quality problems, particularly due to red tide events. Chl-a derived from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on satellite Aqua in Ariake Bay was investigated, and it was determined that the causes of the errors were from inaccurate atmospheric correction and inappropriate in-water algorithms. To improve the accuracy of MODIS remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the blue and green bands, a simple method was adopted using in situ Rrs data. This method assumes that the error in MODIS Rrs(547) is small, and MODIS Rrs(412) can be estimated from MODIS Rrs(547) using a linear relation between in situ Rrs(412) and Rrs(547). We also showed that the standard MODIS Chl-a algorithm, OC3M, underestimated Chl-a, which was mostly due to water column turbidity. A new empirical switching algorithm was generated based on the relationship between in situ Chl-a and the blue-to-green band ratio, max(Rrs(443), Rrs(448)/Rrs(547), which was the same as the OC3M algorithm. The criterion of Rrs(667) of 0.005 sr-1 was used to evaluate the extent of turbidity for the switching algorithm. The results showed that the switching algorithm performed better than OC3M, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of estimated Chl-a decreased from 0.414 to 0.326. The RMSE for MODIS Chl-a using the recalculated Rrs and the switching algorithm was 0.287, which was a significant improvement from the RMSE of 0.610, which was obtained using standard MODIS Chl-a. Finally, the accuracy of our method was tested with an independent dataset collected by the local Fisheries Research Institute, and the results revealed that the switching algorithm with the recalculated Rrs reduced the RMSE of MODIS Chl-a from 0.412 of the standard to 0.335.},

abstract = {Spectrally-resolved water-leaving radiances (ocean colour) and inferred chlorophyll concentration are key to studying phytoplankton dynamics at seasonal and inter-annual scales, for a better understanding of the role of phytoplankton in marine biogeochemistry; the global carbon cycle; and the response of marine ecosystems to climate variability, change and feedback processes. Ocean colour data also have a critical role in operational observation systems monitoring coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and sediment plumes. The contiguous ocean-colour record reached 21 years in 2018; however, it is comprised of a number of one-off missions such that creating a consistent time-series of ocean-colour data requires merging of the individual sensors (including MERIS, Aqua-MODIS, SeaWiFS, VIIRS and OLCI) with differing sensor characteristics, without introducing artefacts. By contrast, the next decade will see consistent observations from operational ocean colour series with sensors of similar design and with a replacement strategy. Also, by 2029 the record will start to be of sufficient duration to discriminate climate change impacts from natural variability, at least in some regions. This paper describes current status and future prospects in the field of ocean colour focussing on large to medium resolution observations of oceans and coastal seas. It reviews the user requirements in terms of products and uncertainty characteristics and then describes features of current and future satellite ocean-colour sensors, both operational and innovative. The key role of in situ validation and calibration is highlighted as are ground segments that process the data received from the ocean-colour sensors and deliver analysis-ready products to end-users. Example applications of the ocean-colour data are presented, focussing on the climate data record and operational applications including water quality and assimilation into numerical models. Current capacity building and training activities pertinent to ocean are described and finally a summary of future perspectives is provided.},

abstract = {Eutrophication is an emerging global issue associated with increasing anthropogenic nutrient loading. The impacts and extent of eutrophication are often limited to regions with dedicated monitoring programmes. Here we introduce the first global and Google Earth Engine-based interactive assessment tool of coastal eutrophication potential (CEP). The tool evaluates trends in satellite-derived chlorophyll- a (CHL) to devise a global map of CEP. Our analyses suggest that, globally, coastal waters (depth ≤200 m) covering ∼1.15 million km 2 are eutrophic potential. Also, waters associated with CHL increasing trends—eutrophication potential—are twofold higher than those showing signs of recovery. The tool effectively identified areas of known eutrophication with severe symptoms, like dead zones, as well as those with limited to no information of the eutrophication. Our tool introduces the prospect for a consistent global assessment of eutrophication trends with major implications for monitoring Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the application of Earth Observations in support of SDGs.},

@article{Lee2002,
abstract = {For open ocean and coastal waters, a multiband quasi-analytical algorithm is developed to retrieve absorption and backscattering coefficients, as well as absorption coefficients of phytoplankton pigments and gelbstoff. This algorithm is based on remote-sensing reflectance models derived from the radiative transfer equation, and values of total absorption and backscattering coefficients are analytically calculated from values of remote-sensing reflectance. In the calculation of total absorption coefficient, no spectral models for pigment and gelbstoff absorption coefficients are used. Actually those absorption coefficients are spectrally decomposed from the derived total absorption coefficient in a separate calculation. The algorithm is easy to understand and simple to implement. It can be applied to data from past and current satellite sensors, as well as to data from hyperspectral sensors. There are only limited empirical relationships involved in the algorithm, and they are for less important properties, which implies that the concept and details of the algorithm could be applied to many data for oceanic observations. The algorithm is applied to simulated data and field data, both non-case1, to test its performance, and the results are quite promising. More independent tests with field-measured data are desired to validate and improve this algorithm.},

@article{Babin2003,
abstract = {We measured the absorption properties of phytoplankton, nonalgal particles (NAP), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) at about 350 stations in various coastal waters around Europe including the English Channel, Adriatic Sea, Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea. For comparison, we also collected data in the open ocean waters of North Atlantic. The exponential slope of the CDOM absorption spectrum varied within a narrow range around 0.0176 nm-1 (SD = 0.0020 nm-1). When data from all the regions were considered altogether, the relationship between phytoplankton absorption and chlorophyll concentration was generally similar to the one previously established for open oceanic waters. Our coastal data, however, show that significant departures from the general trend may occur due to peculiar pigment composition and cell size. In some coastal areas, high phaeopigment concentrations gave rise to especially high blue-to-red ratio of phytoplankton absorption. The NAP absorption covaried with the particle dry weight. Most absorption spectra of these particles were well described by an exponential function with a slope averaging 0.0123 nm-1 (SD = 0.0013 nm-1). In some highly turbid waters, the spectra exhibited a signature possibly associated with iron oxides. In the Baltic Sea, NAP absorption systematically showed lower values at wavelengths shorter than 440 nm than predicted from the fitted exponential function. Overall, the variability in the absorption properties of European coastal waters showed some consistent patterns despite the high diversity of the examined waters. Distinct features were identified in the phytoplankton and NAP components. An absorption budget is presented and parameterizations are proposed.},

@article{OReilly2019,
abstract = {A high degree of consistency and comparability among chlorophyll algorithms is necessary to meet the goals of merging data from concurrent overlapping ocean color missions for increased coverage of the global ocean and to extend existing time series to encompass data from recently launched missions and those planned for the near future, such as PACE, OLCI, HawkEye, EnMAP and SABIA-MAR. To accomplish these goals, we developed 65 empirical ocean color (OC)chlorophyll algorithms for 25 satellite instruments using the largest available and most globally representative database of coincident in situ chlorophyll a and remote sensing reflectances. Excellent internal consistency was achieved across these OC ‘Version -7' algorithms, as demonstrated by a median regression slope and coefficient of determination (R2)of 0.985 and 0.859, respectively, among 903 pairwise comparisons of OC-modeled chlorophyll. SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua satellite-to-in situ match-up results indicated equivalent, and sometimes superior, performance to current heritage chlorophyll algorithms. During the past forty years of ocean color research the violet band (412 nm)has rarely been used in empirical algorithms to estimate chlorophyll concentrations in oceanic surface water. While the peak in chlorophyll-specific absorption coincides with the 443 nm band present on most ocean color sensors, the magnitude of chlorophyll-specific absorption at 412 nm can reach upwards of {\~{}}70{\%} of that at 443 nm. Nearly one third of total chlorophyll-specific absorption between 400 and 700 nm occurs below 443 nm, suggesting that bands below 443 nm, such as the 412 nm band present on most ocean color sensors, may also be useful in detecting chlorophyll under certain conditions and assumptions. The 412 nm band is also the brightest band (that is, with the most dominant magnitude)in remotely sensed reflectances retrieved by heritage passive ocean color instruments when chlorophyll is less than {\~{}}0.1 mg m−3, which encompasses {\~{}}24{\%} of the global ocean. To attempt to exploit this additional spectral information, we developed two new families of OC algorithms, the OC5 and OC6 algorithms, which include the 412 nm band in the MBR. By using this brightest band in MBR empirical chlorophyll algorithms, the highest possible dynamic range of MBR may be achieved in these oligotrophic areas. The terms oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic get frequent use in the scientific literature to designate trophic status; however, quantitative definitions in terms of chlorophyll levels are arbitrarily defined. We developed a new, reproducible, bio-optically based index for trophic status based on the frequency of the brightest, maximum band in the MBR for the OC6{\_}SEAWIFS algorithm, along with remote sensing reflectances from the entire SeaWiFS mission. This index defines oligotrophic water as chlorophyll less than {\~{}}0.1 mg m−3, eutrophic water as chlorophyll above 1.67 mg m−3 and mesotrophic water as chlorophyll between 0.1 and 1.67 mg m−3. Applying these criteria to the 40-year mean global ocean chlorophyll data set revealed that oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic water occupy {\~{}}24{\%}, 67{\%}, and 9{\%}, respectively, of the area of the global ocean on average.},

@techreport{IOCCG2000,
abstract = {Remote sensing of ocean colour is going through a quiet revolution. This IOCCG report aims to bring the news of these developments to a broader community. To understand the magnitude and scope of the revolution, we have to go back to the genesis of ocean-colour remote sensing from space. The Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), the first satellite sensor to monitor ocean colour, was launched by NASA in 1978. At that time, the goals of the mission were modest: to measure water-leaving radiance at a limited number of wavebands in the visible domain, and then to use the signal to infer concentrations of phytoplankton pigments in the near-surface layers of the ocean. The algorithms in routine use made the assumption that the atmospheric and oceanic components of the total signal reaching the satellite sensor could be decoupled using theoretical models of radiative transfer in the atmosphere. The signals corrected for atmospheric noise were then used in empirical algorithms to retrieve concentrations of phytoplankton pigments. Notwithstanding the name of the sensor, it was understood and accepted that the methods in use might not work in coastal, and other optically-complex waters, where the presence of other substances might mask or modify the signal from phytoplankton. The quantitative applications of the retrieved data were therefore largely confined to open-ocean waters. All these ground rules are changing now. Building on the CZCS experience, and learn- ing from theoretical studies and observations from in situ platforms and aircraft, the scope and requirements of remote sensing of ocean colour from space have grown dra- matically over the years. As we understood more about the optical properties of aquatic substances and their influences on ocean colour, it became possible to envisage the use of ocean-colour data to retrieve information on substances other than phytoplankton, or even to distinguish between some types of phytoplankton under favourable conditions. Exploring these possibilities required sensors with better spectral resolution, improved calibration, and higher signal-to-noise ratio than the CZCS. The ocean-colour sensors that followed the CZCS were therefore not replicas, but a different breed of instruments with different capabilities. New algorithms have emerged in parallel, to address the new chal- lenges. These algorithms are also a new breed, and not minor variants of old algorithms. For example, there has been a move towards treating the ocean-atmosphere system as a coupled system, and solving simultaneously for oceanic and atmospheric properties; the empirical algorithms for retrieval of aquatic properties are being abandoned in favour of algorithms that are soundly based on theoretical considerations; and new and pow- erful mathematical and statistical approaches capable of dealing with a multi-variable, non-linear system are being brought to bear on the problem. Most of these developments have focused on improving remote sensing of ocean colour in coastal, and other optically-complex, bodies of water, and this report has the same focus. The report attempts to review the progress made so far in this field, to eval- uate the limitations that exist, and to identify promising avenues for further improve- ment. The report has an introductory chapter that provides the general background to the problem, and a second chapter that outlines the theoretical concept of ocean colour. The third chapter focuses on the various approaches that have been used to address the problem of quantitative remote sensing in optically-complex waters and the fourth chapter discusses the requirements for successful remote-sensing experiments in these waters. The major, potential applications of ocean-colour data are reviewed in the fifth chapter. The report then closes with a summary and conclusions. The contributors to this report have attempted to make the report accessible and useful for the specialist and the non-specialist alike.},

abstract = {While recent research has provided increasing insight into ocean ecosystem functions and rapidly improving predictive ability, it has become clear that for some key processes, including grazing by zooplankton, there simply is no currently available instrumentation to quantify relevant stocks and rates, remotely or in situ. When measurement capacity is lacking, collaborative research between instrument manufacturers and researchers can bring us closer to addressing key knowledge gaps. By necessity, this high risk, high rewards research will require iterative steps from best case scenarios under highly controlled and often artificial laboratory conditions to empirical verification in complex in situ conditions with diverse biota. To illustrate our point, we highlight the example of zooplankton grazing in marine planktonic food webs. Grazing by single-celled zooplankton accounts for the majority of organic carbon loss from marine primary production but is still measured with logistically demanding, point-sample incubation methods that result in reproducible results but at insufficient resolution to adequately describe temporal and spatial dynamics of grazer induced impacts on primary production, export production and the annual cycle of marine plankton. We advance a collaborative research and development agenda to eliminate this knowledge gap. Resolving primary production losses through grazing is fundamental to a predictive understanding of the transfer of matter and energy through marine ecosystems, major reservoirs of the global carbon cycle.},

For larger scale maps, including topographic quadrangles and the State Base Map Series, conformal projections such as the Transverse Mercator and the Lambert Conformal Conic are used. Equal-area and equidistant projections appear in the National Atlas. Other projections, such as the Miller Cylindrical and the Van der Grinten, are chosen occasionally for convenience, sometimes making use of existing base maps prepared by others. Some projections treat the Earth only as a sphere, others as either ellipsoid or sphere. The USGS has also conceived and designed several new projections, including the Space Oblique Mercator, the first map projection designed to permit mapping of the Earth continuously from a satellite with low distortion. The mapping of extraterrestrial bodies has resulted in the use of standard projections in completely new settings. Several other projections which have not been used by the USGS are frequently of interest to the cartographic public. With increased computerization, it is important to realize that rectangular coordinates for all these projections may be mathematically calculated with formulas which would have seemed too complicated in the past, but which now may be programmed routinely, especially if aided by numerical examples.

The style of beer varies across the globe but modern brewing is very much the same regardless of the style. While there are thousands of compounds in beer, current methods of analysis rely mostly on the content of only several important processing parameters such as gravity, bitterness, or alcohol. Near infrared and mid infrared spectroscopy offer opportunities to predict dozens to hundreds of compounds simultaneously at different stages of the brewing process. Importantly, this is an opportunity to move deeper into quality through measuring wort and beer composition, rather than just content. This includes measuring individual sugars and amino acids prior to fermentation, rather than total °Plato or free amino acids content.
