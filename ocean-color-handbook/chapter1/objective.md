# Overall objective

The objective of this e-manual is to equip the user with knowledge and tools to
analyse ocean colour data. The ultimate goal is to be able to apply this
knowledge to environmental conservancy and/or other related marine activities.
Throughout the e-manual there will be use of web-based application tools such as
Anaconda, an open-source package and environment management system, and Jupyter
Notebook, a web-based interactive computing platform.

Throughout the e-manual, various codes for different outputs will be
demonstrated using Anaconda, which manages environments for the Python
programming language. Within an isolated Anaconda based Python environment,
Jupyter Notebook, allows the analyses of satellite data and other computations
to be run on a web-browser. Furthermore, Jupyter Notebook combines live code
with narrative text, equations, and visualisations. Foundations to Python,
Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook are given in [Chapter 2](chapter1).

## Main objectives are as follows:

- Understand satellite-derived parameters used in water quality monitoring.
- Learn to search and retrieve satellite data from data providers specifically
  NASA and JAXA G-Portal.
- Analyse and apply satellite data for water quality monitoring and other marine
  related activities for ocean conservation.
