# Modules Relevant to Ocean Colour Data Analysis

The following table introduces a list of modules relevant to the discussion of
this manual. This list is not exhausting but enough for the data analysis that
will follow in latter parts of the book.

```{table} Modules for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

## Importing Modules into Python

To use packages or libraries in Python, you will need to import them at the
start of your Python code:

```python
import matplotlib.pytplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import h5py
```

Note that for the `matplotlib` library we can also import it using the following
synthax `from â€¦ import` as exemplified below.

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```
