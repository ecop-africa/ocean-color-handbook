sensing as a tool for marine environment protection and conservation Early
Career Ocean Professionals ([ECOP](https://www.ecopdecade.org/africa/) Africa).
In this handbook we delve into the fascinating world of phytoplankton blooms as
viewed by satellites. This interactive sessions that accompany this manual will
empower you to leverage Python for in-depth exploration of marine ecosystems,
providing valuable insights into phytoplankton dynamics. Let's navigate the
waves of remotely sensed data together and unlock the secrets hidden in ocean
colour!
